3. BackEnd: The BackEnd has a configurantion directory in the following path which contains the onfiguration file
   ```bash
   ./src/config/config.json
   ```

   ```bash
    {
    "SERVER": {
        "PORT": 3000
    },
    "CORS": {
        "ORIGINS": [
            "http://localhost:5173",
            "http://10.0.0.199:5173",
            "http://10.0.0.199:4173"
        ],
        "METHODS": [

            "POST"
        ],
        "HEADERS": [
